# Risk reports · Evidence workflow — synthetic public showcase

An independently implemented report-preflight demonstration for fictional case-event linkage, exact product identity, scoped reporting denominators and human review. It produces a local text outline, not a regulated PSUR/PBRER or licensed Word template.

This public repository contains **independently written demonstration code and entirely fabricated fixtures**. It is not a sanitized copy of a production system. No private Git history, company implementation, operational records, real study results, licensed terminology/templates, screenshots, secrets or infrastructure configuration are included.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.13 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

The development server binds to local loopback. The application makes no runtime network requests, has no accounts and accepts no uploaded files. It is independently buildable and has no dependency on another project or data directory.

## What to explore

- Input mapping
- Product and case linkage
- Denominator gate
- Reviewable outline

English and Chinese interfaces are provided. Every displayed example and calculated demo value is synthetic. Browser actions do not create real review records or provide production authorization.
